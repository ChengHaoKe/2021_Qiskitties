# Abstract
The recent trend in fatal police shootings is an urgent issue that requires additional scrutiny. We conducted an in-depth classification analysis into the threat level presented by civilians, and the frequency of shootings by city level to uncover police behavior under various circumstances. Our results revealed that percent of high school completion and poverty rate were significantly associated with shooting frequency, while unusual weapon choices often resulted in a civilian's threat level being classified as an attack.  

# Description
U.S. Census Bureau data on poverty rate, median household income, and racial demographics and Washington Post data on every fatal shooting by a police officer in the line of duty since Jan 1, 2015, were used to train our models. We compared baseline multinomial logistic regression models with QSVM and VQC models and obtained a classification accuracy of 75%/34% for threat level and 89%/84% for frequency of shootings.
